# E-Scholium-Newsletter-Files
Hello! These are the files that are used to power the E-Scholium Newsletter for the The Episcopal Academy's student run publication, Scholium.
It uses MJML and is being deployed to sendinblue
If you want to do something like this yourself, be sure to check out this <a href="https://help.sendinblue.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000268730-Using-SendinBlue-s-New-Template-Language-to-create-email-templates-and-campaigns-NEW-">link<a> for implementing third party created templates into send in blue. For mailchimp, they are called merge tags.
Hopefully, someone finds this useful as their own starting block to start creating email templates in MJML. Thanks!
